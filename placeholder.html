                        Our response incorporates the requests from Burberry for IBM Consulting Service Delivery. As a
                        gesture of goodwill, we are also investigating additional value opportunities outside of the RFP
                        process by reviewing the IBM Technology contract to assess opportunities for simplification in
                        contract renewal. We are also exploring key areas such as SAP AFS where we can share our
                        experience to bring the best to IBM. We will share a point of view on both of these areas
                        separate to the RFO. ​
                    </p>

                    <p><strong>
                            We are committed to sharing the very best of IBM with you- continuing to deliver
                            transformation with speed, precision, and care. Thank you again for allowing us to be part
                            of this process. We look forward to building on our partnership and helping you set a new
                            standard for excellence in Service Delivery as we continue this journey with you. ​
